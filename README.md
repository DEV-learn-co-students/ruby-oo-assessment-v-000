# Basic Object Orientation and Ruby Assessment


## Instructions

Get all the tests passing. Start by running `rspec spec/000_dogs_spec.rb` and follow the instructions. 

Once you're done with `000_dogs_spec.rb`, continue with the other tests (`001_count_sentences_spec.rb`, `002_dice_spec.rb`, etc.)
